Hand Painted 2d Swamp Background
By Trideka Designs


Firstly, thanks for purchasing this asset! 

Included in this package are as follows:

Example Folder
	A dead simple example of how to use the asset.
	Included is a very simple parallax scrolling script,
	created by Unity Tech for their 2D Character 	tutorial.

	The component can be found within the Camera
	gameobject. Access it to change scrolling speed.

	Playing the scene enables an animation on the camera
	to simply move it from left to right, to show off
	the parallaxing effect. 

"Swamp Parallax.prefab"
	A simple prefab with all the image layers
	grouped together and ready to go.

	Simply drag it into your scene view.

	Within the Swamp Parallax parent game object are the 
	layers of the background. Presently they are set to
	the "Default" sorting layer, and are ordered within 	
	it. You may want to change this to your own 	
	background sorting layer.

PSD's of the individual layers. 
	The layers have been painted as such that you should be able 
	to hue-adjust them in Photoshop to customize for yourself. 
	Most layers also work fine on their own should you want a 
	bit less depth.
